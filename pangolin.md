**Pangolins** also known as _scaly anteaters_, are mammals from the order Pholidota and are represented by the family Manidae, which includes three genera: Manis, Phataginus, and Smutsia. Manis has four species native to Asia, while Phataginus and Smutsia each contain two species found in sub-Saharan Africa. These animals, ranging from 30 to 100 cm in size, are distinguished by their unique keratin scales, similar to those of fingernails and toenails, which cover their skin. Pangolins, living in hollow trees or burrows, are nocturnal and feed primarily on ants and termites using their long tongues. They are solitary creatures that only come together to mate and raise a litter of one to three offspring for about two years. Despite their resemblance to armadillos, pangolins are not closely related to them; their similarities result from convergent evolution. Unfortunately, pangolins face severe threats from poaching for their meat and scales, used in traditional medicine, and habitat destruction due to deforestation. As of January 2020, all eight pangolin species are listed as threatened, with three critically endangered, three endangered, and two vulnerable according to the International Union for Conservation of Natureâ€™s Red List [^1].

| 1           | Pangolins are the only mammals with protective keratin scales covering their skin.                                       |
| 2           | They have long, sticky tongues that can extend up to 40 cm (16 inches) to capture ants and termites.                     |
| 3           | Pangolins are nocturnal and primarily solitary, coming together only to mate and raise offspring.                        |
| 4           | Despite their similarity to armadillos, pangolins are not closely related; they have evolved these traits independently. |
| 5           | Pangolins are the most trafficked mammals in the world, with their scales and meat heavily targeted by illegal trade.    |
