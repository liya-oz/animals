## **Whales ** are a diverse group of fully aquatic placental mammals in the infraorder Cetacea, excluding dolphins and porpoises, though they are considered whales in a formal context. They share a common ancestor with hippopotamuses from about 54 million years ago. Whales are divided into baleen whales (Mysticeti), which filter-feed using baleen plates, and toothed whales (Odontoceti), which have conical teeth and exceptional hearing. They range from the small dwarf sperm whale to the massive blue whale, the largest animal ever known. Whales are well-adapted to their oceanic environment, with adaptations such as blubber for insulation and blowholes for breathing. They are warm-blooded, can travel at high speeds, and produce a variety of vocalizations. Historically hunted, whales are now protected by international law, though they still face threats from bycatch and pollution. They play significant roles in various cultures and have become popular subjects in literature, film, and wildlife tourism [^1].
