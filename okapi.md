The okapi (Okapia johnstoni),

## **The okapi** _(Okapia johnstoni)_ also known as the forest giraffe or zebra giraffe, is a unique mammal native to the northeast Democratic Republic of the Congo. Despite its zebra-like stripes, it is closely related to the giraffe, and both are the sole members of the Giraffidae family. Okapis stand about 1.5 meters tall at the shoulder and weigh between 200 to 350 kg. They have a long neck, large ears, and a coat that ranges from chocolate to reddish brown with white stripes on their legs. Primarily diurnal and solitary, they feed on leaves, buds, grasses, fruits, and fungi. They are classified as endangered due to habitat loss, illegal mining, and hunting, with conservation efforts led by the Okapi Conservation Project since 1987 [^1].
