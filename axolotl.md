## **The axolotl** _(Ambystoma mexicanum)_ is a paedomorphic salamander related to the tiger salamander, notable for its ability to reach adulthood without undergoing metamorphosis. Unlike most amphibians, axolotls remain aquatic and gilled throughout their lives. Native to lakes in what is now Mexico City, their habitat was largely destroyed by Spanish settlers, leading to their near-extinction by 2020 due to urbanization, water pollution, and invasive species. Listed as critically endangered, with a population of just 50 to 1,000 individuals, axolotls are extensively studied for their regenerative abilities, including limb, gill, and organ regeneration. They were historically used as food and are sometimes confused with larval tiger salamanders or mudpuppies, which are not closely related [^1].
